## Hi all.

American Passport or Green card holder CHEF, preferably CHEF/STEW needed.

Looking for an energetic and experienced Chef, preferably Chef/Stew for a brand new 75ft vessel also owners private house since the boat is mostly at the house.

Owners are pretty simple with their food choice with focus on Mediterranean cuisine and healthy eating.
Amazing owners to work for. Most of the time your job will be to either cook a light lunch if boss lady has friends over, or more often you will cook for dinner parties for 6-12 people and you will have the whole day to prepare. Would be great if you have a place to stay and are local to Jupiter but liveaboard is possible too.
Occasional short trips down to Miami or the Bahamas, also possibly head next summer to the Hamptons for a month-two.
You will work alongside me and one more female deck/stew.

Salary DOE.

Please DM me your CV, also feel free to ask any questions about the program on WhatsApp or normal message

## Loking for a helper this week on a catamaran I'm running in a marina in Richmond off San Francisco Bay. It's paid work, nothing glamorous mostly cleaning engine rooms and helping me with some wiring projects and taking down some sails. There may be some sea trials and possibly a delivery coming up, so ideally someone interested in learning the boat with an eye towards future sailing. No real experience needed, but it's a nice boat so being careful and not damaging stuff while we work is priority. Boat will provide lunch and all tools and safety equipment needed, plus $200/day. I'm pretty patient (instructor for 20+ years) and it's low stress, happy to explain things as we go.

## We’re looking for a solid deck/stew to join our team on a 102 U.S.-flagged motor yacht. Must have experience driving a center console confidently—this is a big part of the job, and you’ll get a lot of time at the helm. You should also be comfortable with lines, fenders, docking, and have a good, proactive attitude on deck.

Interior duties are minimal—mostly evening turndowns and light guest service when needed. Otherwise, this is a deck-heavy role. There will also be plenty of opportunity to learn basic engineering skills, so if you're mechanically curious and want to build those chops, even better.

Itinerary is summer in the Northeast (think Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, Newport), and winters in the Bahamas and Turks & Caicos. Boat runs both privately and for light charter. We keep things professional but relaxed. Team fit matters—someone who takes pride in their work, has common sense, and doesn’t need their hand held.

U.S. passport or Green Card required. Competitive pay DO
