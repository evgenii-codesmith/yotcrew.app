# Deployment Summary

## Recommended Approach
**Option 2 (Web Service + Background Worker) with Docker**

## Why This Approach?
1. Your application has a continuous scheduler service
2. Scraping tasks can be long-running
3. Playwright requires system dependencies
4. Production applications need better isolation

## Key Files to Create
1. `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
2. `.dockerignore` - Exclude unnecessary files
3. `render.yaml` - Render service configuration
4. `worker.py` - Background scheduler runner

## Deployment Steps
1. Create all configuration files
2. Push to GitHub repository
3. Connect repo to Render
4. Deploy services
5. Set environment variables
6. Test deployment

## Next Steps
1. Create `requirements.txt` with all dependencies
2. Set up database migrations
3. Add health check endpoints
4. Configure monitoring
