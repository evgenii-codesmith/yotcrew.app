# **Architecture Overview: FastAPI & Next.js**

This document outlines the proposed architecture, integrating your existing FastAPI backend with a new Next.js frontend.

## **Architecture Components**

* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
* **Frontend:** Next.js with Tailwind CSS

## **Why Keep FastAPI?**

Your current FastAPI backend is crucial for handling computationally intensive and specialized tasks that Next.js cannot replace. These include:

* Facebook webhook processing  
* spaCy NLP for job detection  
* SQLite database operations  
* Redis caching  
* WebSocket server for real-time updates  
* Leveraging powerful Python libraries (e.g., spacy, googlesearch)

## **What Next.js Adds**

The addition of Next.js for the frontend brings significant benefits for user interaction and data visualization:

* A dedicated user interface to display the processed data.  
* A real-time dashboard connected directly to your FastAPI WebSocket.  
* A beautiful, responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS.  
* A WebSocket client to seamlessly receive real-time updates from the FastAPI backend.

## **Communication Flow**

The data flow within this architecture will follow this path:

**Facebook → FastAPI Webhook → Process & Store Data → WebSocket → Next.js UI**

## **Typical Development Setup**

For local development, the components will typically run on the following ports:

* **FastAPI:** localhost:8000  
* **Next.js:** localhost:3000  
* **Next.js WebSocket Connection:** ws://localhost:8000/ws/jobs (connecting to FastAPI's WebSocket endpoint)

## **Production Deployment**

In a production environment, the setup would typically be:

* **FastAPI:** api.yourdomain.com (serving as the API backend)  
* **Next.js:** yourdomain.com (serving the user-facing application)

Next.js will fetch data from FastAPI through standard API calls and maintain a real-time connection via the WebSocket.

## **Analogy**

Think of this architecture as a collaborative effort:

* **FastAPI is your data engine:** It handles all the heavy lifting, processing, and data management.  
* **Next.js is your dashboard display:** It provides the interactive and visually appealing interface for users to consume and interact with the data.

They work together, each excelling in its specialized role to deliver a powerful and responsive application.
